# TURTLE RACING

Hello everyone!

So, looking to improve my knowledge in Python, I found this project in Tech With Tim. I really liked it, it helped me to expand my programming logic and new libraries that I didn't know as _tk_.

To run the project is simple:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Have Python installed on your machine.
3. Install dependencies (in case tk)
4. Run by typing!

```
python turtleRace.py
```

## Some problems that I had...

The problem that I came up wa when I needed to use Graphical User Interfaces with TK. For me it worked using the default manager of my distribution.

```
sudo pacman -S tk
```

And import in the code using.

```
import tk
```

ou

```
import turtle # turtle uses tk as a dependency
```

Even though I installed it with _pip install_ it didn't work in my case, so I advise you to install it through your default package manager.
